                        Welcome to Bolas, a silly physics simulator that I wrote
                        for fun and as a demonstration of my excellent
                        <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a>
                        and mediocre javascript programming ability. If you just
                        want to play with the bolas, click the button above.

                        project is implemented and deployed.

                        First off, the name: "bolas" is
                        <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"
                            >Portuguese</a
                        >
                        for "balls". Morei em Portugal durante três anos entre
                        2022 e 2025. Escrevi este projeto quando estava a morar
                        lá, portanto, chamo-o "bolas".

                        Why is this interesting to you, recruiter? Well, once
                        you've played the game, you'll see there's some
                        interesting physics simulation being done. Critically,
                        the ball movement and collision detection logic is all
                        done server-side, in rust. The javascript frontend
                        merely receives a stream of updates from a
                        <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API"
                            >websocket</a
                        >
                        connection and draws the balls where it is told to. This
                        is obviously needlessly complicated, but I hope
                        demonstrates my knowledge of websockets, full-stack web
                        development, and rust programming ability. Here's a link
                        to the

                        I deploy this project on a
                        <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">raspberry pi</a>
                        that runs in my house. It exposes this (and several of
                        my other websites) behind
                        <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> using a
                        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/"
                            >cloudflared tunnel</a
                        >. I worked at cloudflare for 5 years, and contributed
                        substantially to the tunnel project, among other things.
                        Cloudflare is also where I learned how to use
                        <a href="https://saltproject.io/index.html">salt</a>,
                        which is how I configure said raspberry pi. The code for
                        doing that is
